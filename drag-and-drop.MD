### What is the Drag and Drop API?
Drag and drop is a popular feature of many Graphical User Interface (GUI) systems. Implementing the same functionality in a browser was an exceedingly difficult task. HTML5 Drag and Drop API enables web applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. This helps web developers to create rich user interfaces which can compete with the desktop user interfaces. The Drag and Drop API allows you to make your divs, spans, and paragraphs draggable. You can drop them onto any other container tags like divs.

### Use cases of the Drag and Drop API
How do you add an item into a shopping cart on an e-commerce web site? You may have to select an item, key in the quantity and click on the 'add to cart' button. Imagine how cool would it be if you could drag an item on to your shopping cart.
