### What is jsfiddle?
sfiddle is a playground for the novice and experienced web developers alike. It is an online web application which allows anyone to play around with html, css and javascript. As you make changes you can see the impact of those changes live.

You need to know a few things to make use of jsfiddle.
1. The html area is the place where you would type all the html tags and the web page text.

2. The css area is the place where you would type in css styling information.

3. The javascript area is the place where you would type in the javascript code to make your web page interactive.

4. The preview area is the place where your web page would be displayed as it would on a web browser.

5. The most important one for you is the "Run" button. Whenever you make any changes in any area, you will have to click on the "Run" button to refresh the preview area.

6. And the best thing about jsfiddle, no matter what you do you can't break anything here.
